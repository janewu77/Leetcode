/**
 * Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.
 *
 * The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.
 *
 * Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
 *
 * You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
 * Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
 * Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range [0, 104].
 * -106 <= Node.val <= 106
